  <h2>What’s expected of hosts?</h2>
  <p>We want to give you clear guidance so you know what’s expected and can provide a 5-star stay every time you share your home.<br/>
We ask all hosts to meet four basic requirements: overall rating, response rate, cancellations and acceptance of reservations. Beyond the basics, you’ll also get reviewed by guests who stay with you.<br/>

<h2>Accept reservation requests</h2>
<p>No guest likes to have to send 4 or 5 requests to find an available place so we expect that if your calendar shows you’re free, you accept most requests. Make sure your listing’s calendar reflects the days you’re able to host. This way you’re more likely to get reservation requests that you can actually accommodate. You can use your availability settings to block time off between bookings, or to prevent requests for same-day reservations or reservations too far in the future.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Avoid cancelling on guests</h2>
<p>We take cancellations seriously and ask all hosts to avoid cancelling on guests–their travel plans depend on it! You’ll be subject to penalties, including financial penalties, if you cancel a confirmed booking. We ask that you avoid canceling confirmed bookings unless there are extenuating circumstances.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Get positive reviews</h2>
<p>Guests like to know they can expect a consistent level of quality, no matter where they book. At the end of each stay, guests will review their experience with you, which is one of the ways we evaluate you as a host. Your overall rating is your average review score from all the guests you’ve hosted.<br/>
As a host, you’ll have an opportunity to rate guests too–on their cleanliness, courteousness, and communication. Your feedback helps us ensure that guests are treating the homes they stay in as if they were their own. Guests who are consistently flagged by hosts may be subject to penalties.</p>
  <hr/>
    <h2>Cleanliness</h2>
    <p>Guests will expect the clean and tidy space they see in your listing photos. Make sure you give yourself enough time to clean between guests, especially when you have back-to-back bookings.
Guests will have the opportunity to rate the cleanliness of your space, and the average of your ratings will appear on your listing page. If you consistently receive low cleanliness ratings, you may be subject to penalties.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Supporting guests during their stay</h2>
<p>Whether or not you’re staying in the space with your guests, it’s important to remain available throughout their stay. Your guests will have the opportunity to rate the clarity and consistency of your communication at the end of their stay—and the average of these guest ratings will appear on your listing page.</p>
